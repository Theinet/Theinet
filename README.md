## 🧠 About Us

**THE INET** is an independent digital initiative from Ukraine focused on custom software development for business needs.

The project began in 2021 as a private concept and expanded in 2024 into a public-facing studio with a website, brand identity, and open-source activity.

We build:

- ✅ Desktop and web applications
- ✅ Automation tools and business utilities
- ✅ Lightweight offline-first software
- ✅ UI/UX design and functional branding

## 🔐 Core Principles

- ❌ **No telemetry. Ever.**  
  All THE INET software is 100% telemetry-free — we do not collect, transmit, or analyze user data.  
  User privacy and digital independence are foundational values.

- 📴 **Works without internet**  
  Wherever possible, our applications are designed to function offline, without constant connectivity.

---

## 🧩 Technology Stack

- 💻 **Desktop Development**:  
  We use **WPF** and **Avalonia UI** for cross-platform and native desktop apps.

- 🌐 **Web Tech**:  
  React, Next.js, Vercel — for web portals, SaaS panels, and admin UIs.

- ⚙️ **Philosophy**:  
  Minimalist, efficient, stable. We don’t chase trends — we build tools.
